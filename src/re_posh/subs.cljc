(defn reg-sub
  "For a given `query-id` register a `config` function and input `signals`

  At an abstract level, a call to this function allows you to register 'the mechanism'
  to later fulfil a call to `(subscribe [query-id ...])`.

  To say that another way, reg-sub allows you to create a template for a node
  in the signal graph. But note: reg-sub does not cause a node to be created.
  It simply allows you to register the template from which such a
  node could be created, if it were needed, sometime later, when the call
  to `subscribe` is made.

  reg-sub needs three things:
    - a `query-id`
    - the required inputs for this node
    - a function that generates config for query or pull for this node

  The `query-id` is always the 1st argument to reg-sub and it is typically
  a namespaced keyword.

  A config function is always the last argument and it has this general form:
  `(input-signals, query-vector) -> a-value`

  What goes in between the 1st and last args can vary, but whatever is there will
  define the input signals part of the template, and, as a result, it will control
  what values the config functions gets as a first argument.
  There's 3 ways this function can be called - 3 ways to supply input signals:

  1. No input signals given:

     (reg-sub
       :query-id
       a-config-fn)   ;; (fn [db v]  ... a-value)
     The node's input signal defaults to datascript database, and the value within `ds` is
     is given as the 1st argument to the computation function.

  2. A signal function is supplied:

     (reg-sub
       :query-id
       signal-fn     ;; <-- here, the form is (fn [db v] ... signal | [signal])
       config-fn)

     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it
     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only
     one, or a sequence if there are many.
     The values from the nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to the
     config function - either a singleton or sequence, paralleling
     the structure returned by the signal function.
     Here, is an example signal-fn, which returns a vector of input signals.
       (fn [query-vec]
         [(subscribe [:a-sub])
          (subscribe [:b-sub])])
     For that signal function, the config function must be written
     to expect a vector of values for its first argument.
       (fn [[a b] _] ....)
     If the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:
        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]
          (subscribe [:a-sub]))
     then the config function must be written to expect a single value
     as the 1st argument:
        (fn [a _] ...)

  3. Syntax Sugar

     (reg-sub
       :a-b-sub
       :<- [:a-sub]
       :<- [:b-sub]
       (fn [[a b] [_]] {:a a :b b}))

  This 3rd variation is syntactic sugar for the 2nd. Pairs are supplied instead
  of an `input signals` functions. Each pair starts with a `:<-` and a subscription
  vector follows.
